  * Matrix elements sum
      * After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.  Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the CodeBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).
  * All longest strings
      * Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.
  * Common Character Count
      * Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.
  * Is lucky
      * Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.  Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.
  * Sort by height
      * Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!
  * Reverse in parentheses
      * Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.  Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.
  * Alternating sums
      * Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.  You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.
  * Add border
      * Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks(*) to it.
  * Are similar
      * Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.  Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.
  * Array change
      * You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.
  * Palindrome rearranging
      * Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
  * Are equally strong
      * Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal. Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms. Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong.
  * Array maximal adjacent difference
      * Given an array of integers, find the maximal absolute difference between any two of its adjacent elements.
  * Is IPV4 Address
      * An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address. Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.
  * Avoid obstacles
      * You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.  Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.  Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.
