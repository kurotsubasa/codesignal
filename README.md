  * Matrix elements sum
      * After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.  Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the CodeBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).
  * All longest strings
      * Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.
  * Common Character Count
      * Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.
  * Is lucky
      * Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.  Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.
  * Sort by height
      * Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!
  * Reverse in parentheses
      * Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.  Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.
  * Alternating sums
      * Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.  You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.
